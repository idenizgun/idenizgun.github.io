    <p>I am a fresh Physics graduate from Istanbul Technical University with a minor in Theoretical Mathematics. I am mostly interested in mathematical physics, cosmology, and ways to improve our understanding of gravity, the standard model, practical applications of known equations, and effects of quantization on such systems (jumping through 5 flaming hoops to not say quantum gravity). I live to learn more mathematics and find joy whenever I see their actual applications in physics. In the meantime, I am also developing myself in the branch of ML and NLP. I'll try to keep my GitHub updated with any relevant projects I may develop regarding ML.</p>

    <p>I believe science, especially maths and physics, is a collaborative effort. I always try my best to help out along the way, so feel free to contact. I've probably been there (I've probably been worse).</p>
