    <p>I am a recent Physics graduate from Istanbul Technical University with a minor in Theoretical Mathematics. I am mostly interested in mathematical physics, cosmology, and ways to improve our understanding of gravity, the standard model, practical applications of known equations, and the effects of quantization on such systems (trying to avoid saying "quantum gravity").
      
      Recently I have developed an interest in all thing quantum as well as Topos Theory and Locale Theory, I would appreciate any guidance on these topics.
      I live to learn more mathematics and find joy whenever I see its actual applications in physics. In the meantime, I am also developing myself in the fields of ML and NLP. I'll try to keep my GitHub updated with any relevant projects I may develop regarding ML. (On hiatus for now) </p>

    <p>I believe science, especially math and physics, is a collaborative effort. I always try my best to help out along the way, so feel free to contact me. I've probably been there (or even worse). My full name is İsmail Deniz Gün / İsmail Deniz Gün (including this for search engine optimization purposes).</p>
