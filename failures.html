    <h1>CV of Failures</h1>
    <p>This is a project that I wanted to do for a while. I guess a CV of Failures only works
        if you have a CV of Successes. But I don't believe who I am is defined by my successes,
        but rather by my stubbornness to best people who are smarter or more capable than me.
        You can view my CV of Failures by clicking the link below. I will try to keep
        it updated as long as I keep remembering embarassing stuff and as I keep failing more.
